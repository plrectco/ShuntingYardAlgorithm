 We also want to allow parentheses in our input. Given an expression string using the "+", "-", "(", and ")" operators like "5+(16-2)", write a function to parse the string and evaluate the result.

 Sample input:
    expression1 = "5+16-((9-6)-(4-2))"
    expression2 = "22+(2-4)"
          
    Sample output:
    evaluate(expression1) => 20
    evaluate(expression2) => 20

Basically, I need to first convert the infix notation into Reversed Poland Notation. which is cover in [Shunting yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm)
